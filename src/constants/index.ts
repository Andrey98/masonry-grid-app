// The Pexels API key is intentionally hardcoded here to simplify the setup process
// for this test task, allowing you to run the project without any additional configuration.
//
// I understand this is not best practice for a production environment due to security concerns.
// In a real-world application, this key would be stored securely in environment variables.
